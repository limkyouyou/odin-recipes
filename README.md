Practice HTML knowledge

This is a project to practice my HTML knowledge which I have learned so far from The Odin Project - Introduction to Web Development. The knowledge includes how to write basic HTML5 boilerplate, file structure, working with heading, paragraph, links, images, and list elements, and making commit on Git.
